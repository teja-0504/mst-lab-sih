It marks Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana and honors Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. People celebrate by lighting oil lamps (diyas), decorating their homes with rangoli, and performing prayers (puja) for prosperity and happiness.</p>
